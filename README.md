# About

Hi, My name is Aya Hourani! As a fresh graduate from Rutgers University with a background of Computer and Software Engineering, I bring a robust set of skills and hands-on experience to the tech landscape. 

My academic journey showcases my proficiency in various industries within the software engineering sphere. During my time as a graduate student, I had the opportunity to work on multiple projects ranging from data analysis and visualization, to web applications, to security within machine learning. These projects allowed me to broaden my knowledge and skills to thrive in the engineering industry. 

My internship as a Software Cloud Developer Intern at Westlock Controls honed my project management, workflow design, and automation skills, utilizing Jira to enhance agile project frameworks. I am eager to use my diverse skill set to contribute innovative solutions and thrive in the dynamic realm of computer and software engineering!

This repository serves as a portfolio showcasing my most recent work Data Analytics/Data Science.

# Portfolio Projects

Here is some of my most recent work! 

### Look Over Here!
**Code:** [Look Over Here! Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/ahourani2000/Data-Scientist-Portfolio/blob/main/MS%20Technical%20Paper.ipynb)

**Technical Paper:** [Look Over Here!](Final_MS_Technical_Paper.pdf)

**Goal:** Establish a relationship between video game performance and gaze data.

**Description:** This project explores the correlation between gaze data and game performance using a dataset featuring 16 Atari games. Leveraging feature engineering and machine learning, the study aimed to discern differences in gaze patterns between skilled and less-skilled players. The main dataset included the game, mean validation error, mean best score, mean top score, and difficulty level. The gaze dataset included (x,y) coordinate pairs for each frame of a video game session for every game.

**Skills:** Data Cleaning, Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Data Visualization, Data Exploration

**Technology:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn

**Results:** The results of this project concluded that there was a correlation between gaze data and game performance. 

### Adversarial Machine Learning with Image Classification
**Code for Image Classifier Model:** [Image Classifier Model](https://github.com/ahourani2000/Data-Scientist-Portfolio/blob/main/Image%20Classifier%20Model.ipynb)

**Code for Adversarial Example:** [PGD Model](https://github.com/ahourani2000/Data-Scientist-Portfolio/blob/main/PGD%20Model.ipynb)

**Technical Paper:** [Adversarial Machine Learning](https://github.com/ahourani2000/Data-Scientist-Portfolio/blob/8ccfeaab108f17898e33146f6deb3eb55ac70364/CSS%20Final%20Project%20Report.pdf)

**Goal:** Build an image classifier model and demonstrate an adversarial example.

**Description:** This project delves into the exploration of adversarial attacks, focusing on white-box scenarios, and introduces the Projected Gradient Descent method as an iterative optimization-based adversarial attack. It describes the process of creating an image classifier model using convolutional neural networks, and demonstrates an example of an adversarial image using PGD.

**Skills:** Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Image Classification, Security 

**Technology:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, Tensorflow, Numpy, Matplotlib, Keras

**Results:** The results demonstrate the model's susceptibility to adversarial perturbations, leading to misclassifications, shedding light on the importance of retraining models with adversarial examples to enhance robustness.
