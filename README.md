# About

Hi, My name is Aya Hourani! As a fresh graduate from Rutgers University with a background of Computer and Software Engineering, I bring a robust set of skills and hands-on experience to the tech landscape. 

My academic journey showcases my proficiency in various industries within the software engineering sphere. During my time as a graduate student, I had the opportunity to work on multiple projects ranging from data analysis and visualization, to web applications, to security within machine learning. These projects allowed me to broaden my knowledge and skills to thrive in the engineering industry. 

My internship as a Software Cloud Developer Intern at Westlock Controls honed my project management, workflow design, and automation skills, utilizing Jira to enhance agile project frameworks. I am eager to use my diverse skill set to contribute innovative solutions and thrive in the dynamic realm of computer and software engineering!

This repository serves as a portfolio showcasing my most recent work Data Analytics/Data Science.
